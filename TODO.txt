Current task: <1>

<0> Transfer window rendering (and clearing the screen) to the "rendering thread" of each window
        - (Manage window context - currently unhandaled!) -- no need
        - Cleanup the GRenderer code: all of the rendering related "stuff" should be done
          inside of GREnderer

<1> Fix GTitle_Bar
    - Possible error in mouse dispatcher (problem found in GTitle_Bar & GResize_Area)
    -> Works exactly like imagined: the GResize_Area was not overlay so the mouse system assigned
       mouse events to the first coordinate match. But found problem <5>

<2> Re-think event system:
        - along the lines - "Should_Close" (type: request, receive), "Close" (type: command, respond), etc.

<3> Implemet CPU-side atlas creation
        - optional: SIMD?

<-4-> Move sending of Enter and Leave events to callback (from dispacher)
        - The sending of Enter and Leave events will stay in dispatcher because
          Leave event always comes before Move event - so if a window ignores Move event,
          there might be a problem with Leave events (further investigation needed)

<5> Problem found with Move, Leave & Enter events. Affected classes: GBasic_Window, GWindow
